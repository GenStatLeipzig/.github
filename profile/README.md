# Genetical Statistics and Systems Biology

The group aims to develop and apply statistical and bioinformatic methods in genetics. This comprises e.g. the planning and conduction of studies, the management and analysis of high-dimensional molecular genetic data (germ line mutations, tumour cell line mutations, expression data, metabolomics), population genetics and integrative genome analyses. The work is accompanied by statistical or continuous modelling of diseases or physiological processes. For this purpose, we cooperate with different national and international study groups of different disease entities or phenotypes.
